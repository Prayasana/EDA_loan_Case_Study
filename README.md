# EDA_loan_case_study

Objective:

The project aims to leverage Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to gain insights into risk analytics within the consumer finance domain. Specifically, we seek to understand patterns influencing the likelihood of loan default and identify key consumer and loan attributes impacting the loan approval decision-making process.


Business Understanding:

Loan providers face challenges in assessing the creditworthiness of applicants with insufficient credit history. Our focus is on a consumer finance company specializing in lending to urban customers. The primary goal is to use EDA to analyze data patterns, ensuring that applicants capable of repaying loans are not rejected while minimizing the risk of default.


Business Objectives:

1. Identify patterns indicating difficulty in paying installments.
2. Inform decision-making processes, including loan denial, loan amount reduction, and adjustment of interest rates for risky applicants.
3. Understand driving factors (driver variables) behind loan default for portfolio and risk assessment.


Approach:
1. Perform EDA to uncover patterns influencing loan default.
2. Identify missing data and employ appropriate methods for handling it.
3. Detect outliers without removing data points.
4. Analyze data imbalance, compute the ratio, and explore insights using visualizations.
5. Conduct univariate, segmented univariate, and bivariate analyses, explaining results in business terms.
6. Find the top 10 correlations for clients with payment difficulties and all other cases.


Data Description:

1. 'application_data.csv': Information about clients at the time of loan application.
2. 'previous_application.csv': Data on the client's previous loan applications.
3. 'columns_description.csv': Data dictionary explaining variable meanings.


Expected Results:

1. Presentation summarizing the analysis approach, insghts, and visualizations.
2. Clearly explained IPython notebook with code, comments, and relevant plots.
3. PDF of power point presentation file with necessary visualizations and results.


Tools Used:
Python for data analysis, visualization, and insights generation.
